### General Background

SmartSend is a B2B platfrom which prodvides innovative packages distribution solutions while relying on it's community - each individual is able to take an active role in SmartSend's system.  
With SmartSend's services we build a connection between retailers that want to deliver goods and producs, couriers who want to earn through delivering those products and costumers that want to free up time and effort to focus on whats more important in life.
SmartSend is an academic project (part of my degree's seminar) which was developed on course of ten months, presented in project's fair and scored a final grade of 95.

On the backend of our systems we gave a strong empahsis on cloud hosting and automatic data handling. With GCP & Firebase we were able to storage large-scale data, while given the option to modify and analyze it with ease. Moreover, Firebase services allowed us to authenticate users, dynamiclly save & delete new data and store logic functions on it's cloud.
